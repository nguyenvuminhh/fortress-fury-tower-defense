    - GUI:
      + other scenes

Sprint 2: 17.03.24

  Done:
    - GUI:
      + made enemy runs smoothly, remove dead enemy image view
      + added infoBox
      + Lobby Scene
      + Headquarter
    - logic:
      + make enemy crash, which reduce HQ's HP
      + can control game speed
      + can save game record for leader board after game end
      + omit class ability. Implemented it in game


  Tested function:
    + speedup()
    + pause()
    + resume()
    + crash()
    + saveRecord()

  Difficulties:
    - Need to make enemy run smoothly (1/5 square/step): resolved
      + tried to place a 5x5 grid on every square
      + tried to place a grid that have 25 times as many square but have the same size as the main grid
      + tried to place a pane and use cordinate to translate the image. There was a bit of inaccuracy in the placement, but I measured the inaccuracy for every blocks and created a constant to adjust.
    - Need to find a way to make the gun shoot at different rate: resolved
      + tried to use timer
      + tried using Thread (it worked)
    - glitch

  Time Spent: 15h

  Schedule: Ahead
